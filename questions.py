##################### Question 1:
# create two varibales named 'variable1' and 'variable2'
# Assign values of these two variables as '10' and '20' respectively
# store product of these values in variable called 'product'
# Print value of product in the format: 'Product of these two variables is <value>'

variable1 = 10
variable2 = 20
product = variable1 * variable2
print(f'product of these two variables is {product}')

##################### Question 2:

# create a list names 'l1' having following values: '1', '4', '50', '45', '54', '100', '50', '65' '200', '1000', '540', '50'
# Print position of element '4' from list 'l1'
# Print number of occurences of element '50' in  list 'l1'
# Print total number of elements in list 'l1'



##################### Question 3:

# create a list names 'l1' having following values: '1', '4', '50'
# print all the elements of the list
# print element less than 10 or index if element is greater than 10

##################### Question 4:

# create a list names 'l2' having following values: '1', '4', '50', '50'
# calculate total number of elements in the list without using 'len' function

##################### Question 5:

# Employees in the company are working for certain hours. The company requires each employee to work for at least target hours.

# hours_employee_has_worked = [3, 4, 5, 9, 1, 4, 1, 0] target = 2
# Print no. of employees who haven't met the target

##################### Question 6:

# Create a list as follows: l4 = [5, 6, 67, 40, 100, 78, 99, 88, 1000, 783]
# print sum of first 5 elements in the list using range function

##################### Question 7:

# create a list as follows: l5 = [5, 6, 67, 40, 100, 78, 99, 88, 1000, 783]
# add following elements to the list l5 '5', '7' using append function
# print the new list

##################### Question 8:

# create a list as follows: l6 = [5, 6, 67, 40, 100, 78, 99, 88, 1000, 783, 6, 7, 9, 10, 55, 45, 5, 33, 60, 77, 80, 94, 567]
# print sum of alternate elements in the list.

##################### Question 9:

#  create a list as follows: l6 = [2,2,1,1,1,2,2]

# Given list l6 of len n, return the majority element.
# The majority element is the element that appears more than ⌊n / 2⌋ times. You may assume that the majority element always exists in the array.
