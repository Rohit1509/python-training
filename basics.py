# Python is a programming language that can be used for Product development, App development, API references, writing Automations.
# These Automations can used for excel file manipulations, extracting data out from excel used for reporting.

######### Question: element to element sum in two lists

################################################ Data types #########################################################################

# Python has different data types like integer, float, string, list, set, dictionary, boolean.
# Variables have values assigned to it. These variables can be referenced anywhere in the code. E.g. 'i', 'f', 's' are variables.

i = 6 # integer i.e. whole number

f = 6.3 # float i.e. decimal integers

# String is always represented in inverted comma
s = 'rucha1599' # string

# Boolean data type is True or False value
b = True

# List can contain duplicate values and the exisiting values can be changed. New elements can be added, deleted.
# List is represented in square brackets
l = ['a', 'bgh', 5, 6, 6.5, 'a', 'b', True] # list

# Sets contain unique values and the values can't be changed. We can only add or delete items
# Set is represented in curly brackets
set = {'a', 'b',  'c'} # set

## Common question: difference between list and set ?

############################################# Mathematical operations and printing results ##########################################

# Assign values to variables
x = 7
y = 8

# Perform mathmatical operation and store result in variables 'a' and 'b'
p = x + y
r = y - x

# Print result of the above operation
print(p)
print(r)
